# 🏦 Simulated Banking System

This project implements a **Simulated Banking System** using C++ to manage bank customers, transactions, and account verifications. It showcases practical usage of various **data structures** including Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Queues, and Binary Search Trees to simulate core banking operations.

## 🔥 Motivation

This project was developed as part of the CS-221 course to practically demonstrate how data structures and algorithms can be applied in real-world applications, especially within the financial domain. It aims to prepare students for challenges at the intersection of **technology and finance**.

---

## ✨ Features

- Add and manage bank customers
- Perform secure transactions (Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer)
- View transaction history
- Display account details and current balances
- Verify account existence using a Binary Search Tree
- PIN-based access control for secure transactions

---

## 🏗 Project Structure

```cpp
- Transactions Class     -> Handles transaction types and amounts
- Node Class             -> Stores customer details and transaction queue
- BankingSystem Class    -> Manages all accounts using multiple data structures
- main()                 -> Provides a menu-driven interface for interaction
```

## 🧠 Data Structures Used

| Data Structure       | Purpose                                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Linked List          | Stores customer nodes                        |
| Hash Table (`unordered_map`) | Fast account lookup via account number   |
| Queue                | Maintains transaction history                |
| Binary Search Tree (`set`)  | Verifies if an account exists             |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Open Account**: Adds a new customer node to the linked list, maps it in the hash table, and inserts the account number into the BST.
2. **Transaction Handling**: Requires PIN verification before allowing:
   - Deposits
   - Withdrawals (with balance checks)
   - Fund transfers (with account existence and balance validation)
3. **Transaction History**: Stored as a queue per user, displaying in FIFO order.
4. **Display Functions**: Show account details and balances for all users or specific accounts.
5. **Verification**: Quickly checks for account existence using BST.

## 📱 Applications

- **Educational Tool**: Great for learning DS&A through simulation.
- **Prototype for Internet/Mobile Banking** systems.
- **Secure Login Mechanisms** using PIN authentication.
- **Foundation for Fraud Detection Systems**.

---

## 🎯 Benefits

- Efficient customer management
- Organized and secure transaction history
- Fast and reliable account lookups
- Simple yet realistic simulation of banking operations

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Compile the Code**: Use any C++ compiler like `g++`
   ```bash
   g++ -o bank main.cpp
   ./bank
   ```
2. **Interact via CLI**:
   - Choose from options to create accounts, make transactions, view balances, etc.
   - Follow on-screen instructions for input.
